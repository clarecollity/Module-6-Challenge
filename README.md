# Module-6-Challenge

## Purpose
The purpose of this challenge is to analyze real estate data in San Francisco. This is done by calculating the average prices of all of the neighborhoods and showing them on an interactive map. From the data and visualizations, we can study the trends between rent costs and sale prices for each neighborhood.
